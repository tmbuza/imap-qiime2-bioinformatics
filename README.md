# My Snakemake Workflow Template
<!--## Rules for inclusion in Snakemake catalog
- [Source](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/?rules=true).
- The workflow is contained in a public Github repository.
- The repository has a readme, containing the words "snakemake" and "workflow" (case insensitive).
- The repository contains a workflow definition named either Snakefile or workflow/Snakefile.
- If the repository contains a folder rules or workflow/rules that folder must at least contain one file ending on .smk.
- The repository is small enough to be cloned into a Github actions job (very large files should be handled via Git LFS, so that they can be stripped out during cloning).
- The repository is not blacklisted here.
