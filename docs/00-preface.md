# Microbiome Bioinformatics with QIIME2 {#qiime2-platform}

In this edition, we continue our exploration of microbiome bioinformatics, specifically delving into the integration of the QIIME2 pipeline following the Mothur Microbiome Analysis discussed in earlier chapters. This transition marks a crucial phase in our practical user guides, aiming to equip readers with advanced skills for comprehensive microbiome research. The seamless integration of QIIME2 builds upon the foundational knowledge established in preceding chapters, providing a holistic understanding of modern bioinformatics approaches in the field of microbiome analysis. We invite you to embark on this journey, embracing the evolving landscape of microbiome research and enhancing your proficiency in cutting-edge bioinformatics techniques.
